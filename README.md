ClauseBuddy AI

A browser extension that helps users understand legal documents before they accept them.

ClauseBuddy scans Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, and similar legal pages and shows users what really matters in seconds. It highlights risky clauses, privacy concerns, and safety protections using a clear traffic-light system.

🚀 What ClauseBuddy Does

When you open a legal page (like a Privacy Policy or Terms of Service), ClauseBuddy:

Extracts the text from the page

Identifies risky, concerning, and safe clauses

Displays a traffic-light score

Shows the actual sentences that triggered each warning

Provides a simple chat interface for clarifying questions

It works instantly without requiring any manual copy-paste.

🟢 Traffic Light System
Color	Meaning
🔴 Red	High-risk clauses (data sharing, liability, termination, etc.)
🟡 Yellow	Privacy or tracking concerns
🟢 Green	User-friendly protections

A safety score out of 100 is calculated based on these signals.

💬 Chat (Demo Mode)

The chat lets users ask questions about the document.
For reliability on free infrastructure, it responds based on the detected clauses in the page so it always gives meaningful answers even if cloud AI is unavailable.

Example:

“Can they share my data?”
→ “Yes. Based on this page: We may share your information with third parties…”

🧠 How It Works

ClauseBuddy uses a hybrid system:

Local Scan (Always On)

Reads the full page in the browser

Detects key legal patterns

Shows real sentences from the website

Cloud AI (When Available)

Sends a small portion of the document to an AI model

Generates natural-language summaries and deeper explanations

If AI is unavailable, ClauseBuddy continues to work using the local scan.
